### README: **Student Prediction System**

---

#### **Overview**
The **Student Prediction System** is a Java-based application that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on various academic and personal factors. The application uses a **Random Forest model** and provides actionable feedback to users on how they can improve their performance based on their input.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Prediction Model**:
   - Uses a Random Forest algorithm to predict if a student will pass or fail.
   - Provides highly accurate results based on trained data.

2. **Feedback System**:
   - Offers personalized feedback by comparing user input to the average values of passing students.
   - Focuses only on factors under the user's control, such as study hours, attendance, and motivation.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - User-friendly interface built using Java Swing.
   - All interactions happen within a single window using a card-based layout.
   - Input fields include numeric text boxes and dropdown menus for categorical features.

4. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Displays a mission statement and update notes on the welcome screen.
   - Users can navigate between screens seamlessly.

---

#### **Upcoming Changes**
- **Feedback System**:
  - Feedback will be enhanced to provide more precise recommendations and improved comparisons.
  - Categorical feedback will use descriptive names like "High", "Medium", and "Low" instead of numerical values.
  - Numerical values will be rounded to the nearest whole number for better readability.

- **GUI Improvements**:
  - Consistent and responsive design across all screens.
  - Improved input validation with clear error messages.
  - Additions such as better spacing, padding, and overall visual enhancements.

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Comprehensive unit tests will be added to ensure the correctness and reliability of core functionalities, including:
    - Random Forest prediction.
    - Feedback generation.
    - GUI input validation.

- **Code Refactoring**:
  - Streamline code structure to follow the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern more strictly.
  - Reduce complexity and improve readability for better maintainability.

#### **How to Run**
1. **Compile All Files**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java MainView.java FeedbackAnalyzer.java RandomForest.java DataLoader.java DataPoint.java DecisionTree.java
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

---

#### **Usage**
1. Launch the program to see the welcome screen with a mission statement.
2. Enter your name and proceed to the prediction input screen.
3. Fill in the input fields (study hours, attendance, etc.) and submit.
4. View the prediction result (Pass/Fail) and personalized feedback.

---

#### **System Requirements**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or later.
- Compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

---

#### **Future Development**
- **Enhancements in Feedback**:
  - Provide more detailed comparisons for borderline cases.
  - Allow users to save or export feedback.

- **User Experience**:
  - Implement tooltips and guides for input fields.
  - Provide a summary report of the prediction and feedback.

- **Testing and Validation**:
  - Add test cases for edge scenarios to validate the robustness of the prediction system.
